# Comic FMV

Compute fair market value from real eBay sold transactions. No multiplier math — just recent comps in the target condition.

The full math spec — grade parsing, pool-building/widening, IQR trim, grade-curve interpolation, the CGC-proxy fallback, the confidence rubric, caching internals, the manual fallback (CLI unavailable), and the CLI-debugging Common Mistakes table — lives in `docs/conventions/fmv-math-spec.md`. Read it only when debugging the CLI, building a new consumer, or doing a manual fallback computation. Everything below is what the default path needs.

## How to run

**Default path: `comic-fmv`.** It handles fetch (via `ebay-sold-comps`), cache, dedup, hard-excludes, grade parsing, IQR + quartiles, confidence rubric, self-exclusion, and DB upsert.

Before running, ensure `SERPAPI_KEY` is set — source the canonical env file if not:

```bash
set -a && source ~/Projects/comic-pipeline/apps/ebay/.env && set +a
```

Then resolve and health-gate the comics server — **every run, on this default path, not just as a manual fallback** (BUI-439: `comic-fmv` reads `COMICS_SERVER_URL` from env only and hard-fails "must be set" if it's unset — a Mac Mini/MacBook shell that hasn't exported it needs the hostname fallback below, or the CLI dies before it ever queries anything). `comic-fmv` is a **child process**, not an HTTP call this shell makes itself, so it needs the var actually exported into this shell's env (not just resolved inside a one-off `comics-api` subprocess) — `comics_resolve_server` still does that part. Route the health-check itself through `comics-api` (BUI-510) rather than the raw `comics_health_gate` call, so it shares the exact same call path every other skill's server check uses:

```bash
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/scripts/comics-server.sh"
comics_resolve_server || exit 1   # exports COMICS_SERVER_URL for comic-fmv below
comics-api GET /health >/dev/null || exit 1   # the server must answer
```

If either step fails, **stop immediately** — the comics server is unreachable or the machine is unrecognised, so FMV data cannot be saved. Do not proceed with any queries.

```bash
comic-fmv --batch <working_list.json> --out <results.json> --brief
```

`--batch` JSON shape: `[{item_id, title, issue, year, publisher?, variant?, grade, grade_confidence?, locg_id?, locg_variant_id?, notes?}, ...]`

`publisher` and `variant` are optional but **load-bearing** (BUI-161): `ebay-sold-comps` appends `publisher` to the eBay search query — strongly recommended for non-Marvel/DC titles, where it's the primary noise filter that keeps trading cards / unrelated matches out of the comp pool — and `variant` (e.g. `Newsstand`, `Direct`) gives base vs variant editions distinct `comic_id`s (BUI-28), so omitting it conflates two sub-markets onto one comic.

`grade_confidence` (optional, `high`|`medium`|`medium-low`|`low` — **four** levels, BUI-162) is the photo-coverage confidence from `/comic:grade`. When present and low, it haircuts the max bid — `medium-low` and `low` haircut **differently** (0.70 vs 0.60), so don't collapse them. Absent → standard 80% bid, no haircut (back-compat for seller-stated grades and manual runs).

**`title` is normalized automatically (BUI-346)** — you don't need to hand-clean it before building the working list. `comic-fmv` strips a leading article (`The`/`A`/`An`) and an embedded `#<issue>` (or bare trailing issue number) that duplicates the separate `issue` field, before the title ever reaches `ebay-sold-comps`. Real incident: `"The Amazing Spider-Man #50"` alongside `issue: "50"` built the doubled, malformed query `"The Amazing Spider-Man #50 50"` — 0 results on every tier (ASM #50, 2026-07-13). `ebay-sold-comps`' `build_query` carries the same normalization as a second, independent layer, so a title that reaches it un-normalized (e.g. a direct `--title` CLI call) is still safe.

Flags:
- `--max-age-days N` (default 7): reuse FMVs already in the comics server's DB if `fmv_updated_at` is within N days
- `--force`: bypass both the SerpApi cache and the DB cache and recompute everything
- `--grade-window N` (default 2.0): raise or lower the comp-pool widening ceiling — does **not** bypass the one-sided/too-wide guards (a guarded book still flags `needs_manual`)
- `--brief`: after the table, print one compact JSON object per row (`item_id`, `comic_id`, `fmv_id`, `max_bid`, `flag_reason`, `confidence`) — the linkage fields to carry forward, without re-reading the full `--out` file
- `--quiet`: suppress the human table on stdout (combine with `--brief` for JSON lines only)
- `--server-url URL`: override `COMICS_SERVER_URL`/`GIXEN_SERVER_URL` for this run
- `--version`: print the installed version plus the git SHA/date the binary was built from, then exit

The CLI prints a human-readable table to stdout and writes the full structured result to `--out` on disk. Present the table to the user. **Carry the `--brief` JSON lines forward to Step 4 of `/comic:buy`** (`item_id`, `comic_id`, `fmv_id`, `max_bid`, `flag_reason`, `confidence`) — don't re-read the full `--out` JSON for linkage; the `--out` file on disk stays available if you need a full row (`queries_used`, `trimmed_pool`, etc.) for debugging.

**Stale install risk (BUI-305):** `apps/fmv` is `uv tool install`-managed, not a workspace member kept current by `uv sync` — same category of risk as the eBay tools' stale-wrapper issue (BUI-27, documented in `scripts/install.sh` and `CLAUDE.md`). A `comic-fmv` binary that's behind the repo silently runs old pricing logic (missing safety guards, bugfixes, etc.) with no error to signal it. If pricing looks off, or after pulling changes to `apps/fmv/src/`, run `comic-fmv --version` and compare the git SHA/date to `git log -1 --format='%h %cd' --date=short` (the build hook stamps whole-repo HEAD, not just `apps/fmv/`, so compare against unfiltered HEAD — a path-scoped `-- apps/fmv/src` comparison will false-positive on every unrelated commit elsewhere in the monorepo); if they don't match, re-run `./scripts/install.sh`.

**`fetch-err` ≠ `n/a` (BUI-143):** a row whose FMV column reads `fetch-err` (and the loud post-table warning) means the **SerpApi fetch failed** for that book — quota exhausted or an outage — **not** that the book has no comps. Treat a `fetch-err` row (or a whole batch that comes back all `fetch-err`/`n/a`) as a SerpApi failure: check the `SERPAPI_KEY`/quota and re-run. Never tell the user these books are illiquid or bid on them as if priced.

## Reading the output table

```
| # | Comic | Grade | FMV Range | Median | n | Window | CV | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | X-Men #31 (1967) | VF+ 8.5 | $100-175 | $135 | 9 | ±0.5 | 22% | HIGH | — |
| 4 | FF #63 (1967) | NM+ 9.6 | needs_manual | — | 5 | ±1.0 | n/a | — | manual_review=one_sided |
```

- **`needs_manual` reasons** — `too_sparse` (fewer than 2 comps survive IQR trim), `one_sided` (every comp sits on one side of the target grade, no bracket), `too_wide` (the pool brackets the target but spans more than 2.0 grade points). A flagged book still gets a linked, traceable comic stub (`comic_id`, `manual_review=<reason>` in notes) but emits **no bid-able number** — never invent one from the smeared/one-sided pool; hand-price via the math spec's §7/§7a or leave it for manual review.
- **`first_party=<count>` token** in `fmv_notes` — `fmv_comps`/`N` isn't purely a SerpApi count; it may fold in first-party comps from your own resolved WON/LOST auctions for that `(comic, grade)`. Check for this token before assuming `N` is all SerpApi.
- **CGC-proxy rows** — notes carry `CGC proxy: … n=<count> is graded-ladder comps, not raw-market depth`. Never read a proxy row's `N` as raw-market liquidity.

When presenting the table to the user, always surface: the window the pool was built at, N and CV, whether the book flagged `needs_manual` (and why) vs. auto-priced, whether grade-curve interpolation was applied, suspect comps (with reason), and a hot-market signal if the current bid already exceeds the computed Q75.

## Save to DB

`comic-fmv` upserts each priced comic into the comics server's `comics` table automatically (`POST /api/comics`) right after computing FMV — this is the authoritative comic-metadata write `/comic:snipe-add` later links a bid to; no manual step is needed on the default path. See `docs/conventions/fmv-math-spec.md` for the manual `curl` equivalent and full field semantics (needed only if `comic-fmv` is unavailable).
